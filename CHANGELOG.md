# Changelog

## v1.5.0 (2026-10-28)
- New default **Look-ahead camera**: the bike sits low on screen, the zoom is based on stopping distance (up to 220 m ahead at top speed), and the view turns towards the track ahead so corners show up early.
- C now cycles through Look-ahead, Rotating and North up. Saved options switch once to the new camera.
- Rotating camera: the bike no longer drops off the bottom of the screen at top speed.
- Bikes are drawn larger when zoomed out. Coarser world tiles keep the zoomed-out view at 60 fps.

## v1.4.0 (2026-10-28)
- Game design document (`docs/GDD.md`), source split into `src/`, `tools/build.py`.
- Speed guide panel moved directly under the lap stopwatch.

## v1.3.0 (2026-10-26)
- Player laps saved between sessions ("Your laps" panel, best per mode, all-time row in practice).
- Practice speed guide option: recommended speed, next braking point, coloured line ahead.

## v1.2.0 (2026-10-25)
- Performance: static world baked into tiles, capped and adaptive pixel ratio, no backdrop blur.

## v1.1.0 (2026-10-25)
- Fixed garbled text when opening the file from disk (ASCII-only build with charset).

## v1.0.0 (2026-10-25)
